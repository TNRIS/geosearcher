# geosearcher

This example app shows the basic integration of a geocoder component built with
[downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift) into a react app with a
mapbox gl map. The geocoder uses the TNRIS nominatim geocoding service. The
component will also work with other mapping libraries if the map code is
adjusted for that library.
